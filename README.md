# hello-world
The time-honored tradition of the first repository


Hello reader!

Brian here, just a newbie to github fulfilling the first task, as requested by overlords of github.  
I'm a grad student at SDSU studying statistics and enjoying learning the coding aspect of all of it.

I look forward to hopefully speaking with many and exchanging ideas!  I hope you have a great rest of your day.
